### Problem to fix


* Date was not yet fixed. If you move from 2024 to 2023 for example, the note added will remain. I just don't know what to do with this. I don't know how I will link the [date and time with the app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/datepicker?view=net-maui-8.0).
* Clicking dates would output another view. Done but I will make the UI better.
* Fix update and delete button separate view/page.
